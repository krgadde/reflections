How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is very tough to track. more is required.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    That really helps me to track information from scratch and restored whenever required.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros : we can see each version with minor change. Logical change should be committed.
    Cons : More space required

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    GIT and SVN support software project where files are inter related and need commit together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - to find all history for the git.
    git diff <New ID> <OLD ID> - to find how many lines added/deleted for each commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    This is very good way of tracking code and any other document as well.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Yes.I want to try that.
